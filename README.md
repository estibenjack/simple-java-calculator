# Simple Calculator in Java

A simple, functional calculator built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with features like decimal input, negation, and error handling for division by zero.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Decimal Support**: Enter decimal numbers for more precise calculations.
- **Negation**: Toggle the sign of the number using the `(-)` button.
- **Clear and Delete**: Clear the input or delete the last character entered.
- **Division by Zero Handling**: Displays an error message when attempting to divide by zero.
- **Formatted Output**: Results are displayed as integers when no decimal is present.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher (Java 21 recommended for best compatibility)
- No additional libraries required; uses Java's built-in Swing for GUI components.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the Java file:
javac Calculator.java
3. Run the program:
java Calculator

The calculator window will appear, and you can start performing calculations.
